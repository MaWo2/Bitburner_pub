# My repository for Bitburner scripts
2022-06-14

## Disclaimer
This repository is just here to help me play the Bitburner game (https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner). I especially use it to get scripts I developed in one game into a "fresh" instance of the game. It is a public repository, because at the time of writing it is not possible to use 'wget' inside bitburner with private github repositories.

**I am just a hobbyist programmer and do not claim any professionalism.**

Accordingly, I will not react to any Pull-/Merge-Requests.

My scripts are usually functional to an extend I can live with. However, they are probably not in line with best-practices in programming.

If you can live with this, feel free to use them (for your game or inspiration or whatever). If not, please look somewhere else.
